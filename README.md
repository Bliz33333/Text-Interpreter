# Text-Interpreter

A program that takes raw latin text/translations from a text file and formatts it into a format that can easily and quickly be loaded into the main program. Generally this means splitting up the text by line/couplet, putting the translation next to the coressponding line/sentance, and removing any unneeded spaces tabs etc.
