Ergo tam doctae nobis periere tabellae,
	scripta quibus pariter tot periere bona!
Therefore my tablets, so clever, have been lost,
	together with which so many good literary works were lost!

has quondam nostris manibus detriverat usus,
	qui non signatas iussit habere fidem.
their former usage had worn these with my hands,
	which ordered (one) to have faith, though not sealed.

illae iam sine me norant placare puellas,
	et quaedam sine me verba diserta loqui.
they already had found out how to please girls without me,
	and to speak certain eloquent words without me.

non illas fixum caras effecerat aurum:
	vulgari buxo sordida cera fuit.
attached gold had not completed those dear tablets:
	it was dirty wax on common boxwood.

qualescumque mihi semper mansere fideles,
	semper et effectus promeruere bonos.

et quaecumque volens reperit non stulta puella
	garrula, cum blandis dicitur hora dolis.
and whatever a not foolish, chatty girl discovers willingly
	when the hour for flattering deceits is appointed.

me miserum, his aliquis rationem scribit avarus
	et ponit duras inter ephemeridas!
Poor me, some miser is writing his account on these
	and he is putting them among his harsh business records!

quas si quis mihi rettulerit, donabitur auro:
	quis pro divitiis ligna retenta velit?
If someone returns these to me, he will be gifted with gold:
	who would want wood kept in exchange for riches?

i puer, et citus haec aliqua propone columna,
	et dominum Esquiliis scribe habitare tuum.
Go, boy, swiftly display these (words) on some column,
	and write that your master lives on the Esquiline.
