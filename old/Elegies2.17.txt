Mentiri noctem, promissis ducere amantem,
	hoc erit infectas sanguine habere manus!
To lie about the night, to lead on a lover with promises,
	this will be having hands stained with blood!

horum ego sum vates, quotiens desertus amaras
	explevi noctes, fractus utroque toro.
I am the poet/prophet of these, as often as I’ve filled the bitter
	nights, having been deserted, broken on each bed.

vel tu Tantalea moveare ad flumina sorte,
	ut liquor arenti fallat ab ore sitim;
You may either be moved to the rivers of Tantalus by fate,
	as the liquid from his dry mouth fails his thirst:

vel tu Sisyphios licet admirere labores,
	difficile ut toto monte volutet onus;
or wonder at the labors of Sisyphus,
	as he rolls his difficult burden on all the mountain;

durius in terris nihil est quod vivat amante,
	nec, modo si sapias, quod minus esse velis.
there is nothing in (all) the lands that lives more harshly than a lover,
	If only you were wise, you would not want less to be that.

quem modo felicem invidia admirante ferebant,
	nunc decimo admittor vix ego quoque die.
I, whom they recently used to say was happy, with Envy gazing passionately,
	now am admitted only just on each tenth day.

nunc iacere e duro corpus iuvat, impia, saxo,
	sumere et in nostras trita venena manus;
Now it pleases me to prostrate my body from the hard rock, impious girl,
	and to take ground poisons in my hands;

nec licet in triviis sicca requiescere luna,
	aut per rimosas mittere verba fores.
and I may not rest in the crossroads under the dry moon,
	or send words through the door full of cracks.

quod quamvis ita sit, dominam mutare cavebo:
	tum flebit, cum in me senserit esse fidem.
Although this may be so, I will be careful about changing my mistress.
	Then she will cry, when she will have realized there was loyalty in me.
