Mentiri noctem, promissis ducere amantem,
 To lie about the night, to lead on a lover with promises,
    hoc erit infectas sanguine habere manus!
 this will be having hands stained with blood!
horum ego sum vates, quotiens desertus amaras
 I am the poet/prophet of these, as often as I’ve filled the bitter
    explevi noctes, fractus utroque toro.
nights, having been deserted, broken on each bed.
vel tu Tantalea moveare ad flumina sorte,
 You may either be moved to the rivers of Tantalus by fate,
    ut liquor arenti fallat ab ore sitim;
as the liquid from his dry mouth fails his thirst:
vel tu Sisyphios licet admirere labores,
 or wonder at the labors of Sisyphus,
    difficile ut toto monte volutet onus;
as he rolls his difficult burden on all the mountain;
durius in terris nihil est quod vivat amante,
there is nothing in (all) the lands that lives more harshly than a lover,
    nec, modo si sapias, quod minus esse velis.
 If only you were wise, you would not want less to be that.
quem modo felicem invidia admirante ferebant,
 I, whom they recently used to say was happy, with Envy gazing passionately,
    nunc decimo admittor vix ego quoque die.
now am admitted only just on each tenth day.
nunc iacere e duro corpus iuvat, impia, saxo,
 Now it pleases me to prostrate my body from the hard rock, impious girl,
    sumere et in nostras trita venena manus;
 and to take ground poisons in my hands;
nec licet in triviis sicca requiescere luna,
and I may not rest in the crossroads under the dry moon,
    aut per rimosas mittere verba fores.
 or send words through the door full of cracks.
quod quamvis ita sit, dominam mutare cavebo:
Although this may be so, I will be careful about changing my mistress.
    tum flebit, cum in me senserit esse fidem.
Then she will cry, when she will have realized there was loyalty in me.
