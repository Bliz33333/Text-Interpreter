Quicumque ille fuit, puerum qui pinxit Amorem,
	nonne putas miras hunc habuisse manus?
Whoever he was who painted the boy Cupid,
	don’t you think he had amazing hands?

is primum vidit sine sensu vivere amantes,
	et levibus curis magna perire bona.
He first saw that lovers live without sense,
	and that their great wealth is destroyed by trivial concerns.

idem non frustra ventosas addidit alas,
	fecit et humano corde volare deum:
Not for nothing did that same man add swift wings
	and he made the god fly in the human heart:

scilicet alterna quoniam iactamur in unda,
	nostraque non ullis permanet aura locis.
Of course because we are jerked about on mutual wave,
	and our breeze stays not in any (one) place.

et merito hamatis manus est armata sagittis,
	et pharetra ex umero Cnosia utroque iacet:
And rightly is his hand armed with barbed arrows,
	and his Cretan quiver lies on either shoulder:

ante ferit quoniam, tuti quam cernimus hostem,
	nec quisquam ex illo vulnere sanus abit.
since he strikes before we safely perceive that he’s an enemy
	and not anyone goes away from that wound healthy (i.e. not lovesick).

in me tela manent, manet et puerilis imago:
	sed certe pennas perdidit ille suas;
his darts endure in me, his boyish image endures, too:
	but surely he has lost his wings;

evolat heu nostro quoniam de pectore nusquam,
	assiduusque meo sanguine bella gerit.
since he flies out - alas! - from our heart to nowhere,
	and he constantly wages wars in my blood.

quid tibi iucundum est siccis habitare medullis?
	si pudor est, alio traice duella tua!
Why is it pleasing for you to live in my dry marrow?
	If there is any sense of decency (for you), transfix your wars somewhere else!

intactos isto satius temptare veneno:
	non ego, sed tenuis vapulat umbra mea.
It is better to try the untouched with that poison of yours:
	Not I, but my feeble ghost is beaten.

quam si perdideris, quis erit qui talia cantet,
	(haec mea Musa levis gloria magna tua est),
Who will there be to sing such things if you destroy it (i.e. my ghost),
	(this, my trifling Muse is your great glory),

qui caput et digitos et lumina nigra puellae,
	et canat ut soleant molliter ire pedes?
who would celebrate my girl’s head and fingers and dark eyes,
	and how gently her feet are accustomed to go?
