Quicumque ille fuit, puerum qui pinxit Amorem,
 Whoever he was who painted the boy Cupid,
   nonne putas miras hunc habuisse manus?
 don’t you think he had amazing hands?
is primum vidit sine sensu vivere amantes,
 He first saw that lovers live without sense,
   et levibus curis magna perire bona.
 and that their great wealth is destroyed by trivial concerns.
idem non frustra ventosas addidit alas,
 Not for nothing did that same man add swift wings
   fecit et humano corde volare deum:
 and he made the god fly in the human heart:
scilicet alterna quoniam iactamur in unda,
 Of course because we are jerked about on mutual wave,
   nostraque non ullis permanet aura locis.
and our breeze stays not in any (one) place.
et merito hamatis manus est armata sagittis,
And rightly is his hand armed with barbed arrows,
   et pharetra ex umero Cnosia utroque iacet:
 and his Cretan quiver lies on either shoulder:
ante ferit quoniam, tuti quam cernimus hostem,
since he strikes before we safely perceive that he’s an enemy
   nec quisquam ex illo vulnere sanus abit.
and not anyone goes away from that wound healthy (i.e. not lovesick).
in me tela manent, manet et puerilis imago:
 his darts endure in me, his boyish image endures, too:
   sed certe pennas perdidit ille suas;
 but surely he has lost his wings;
evolat heu nostro quoniam de pectore nusquam,
 since he flies out - alas! - from our heart to nowhere,
   assiduusque meo sanguine bella gerit.
 and he constantly wages wars in my blood.
quid tibi iucundum est siccis habitare medullis?
 Why is it pleasing for you to live in my dry marrow?
si pudor est, alio traice duella tua!
 If there is any sense of decency (for you), transfix your wars somewhere else!
intactos isto satius temptare veneno:
 It is better to try the untouched with that poison of yours:
   non ego, sed tenuis vapulat umbra mea.
 Not I, but my feeble ghost is beaten.
quam si perdideris, quis erit qui talia cantet,
 Who will there be to sing such things if you destroy it (i.e. my ghost),
   (haec mea Musa levis gloria magna tua est),
 (this, my trifling Muse is your great glory),
qui caput et digitos et lumina nigra puellae,
 who would celebrate my girl’s head and fingers and dark eyes,
   et canat ut soleant molliter ire pedes?
and how gently her feet are accustomed to go?
